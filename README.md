<h3>INTRODUCTION & PREPARATION</h3>
I am an undergraduate BPIE (Berkeley Physics International Education) visiting student in my third year of undergrad. Here I am learning QFT II (include renormalization, gauge theory and basic AdS/CFT duality) after Professor Horava and trying hard to study string theory and CFT by my own.
	I have some basic knowledge of four mechanics (analytic, statistical, quantum and electrodynamics) and GR (Cean Carroll) as well as normal QFT I (perturbative theory, Weinberg volume I Chp 1-5). Apart from that some basic mathematical knowledges are also familiar to me: I have learned basic algebra and some Lie theory (to the classification of semisimple Lie algebra), as well as basic differential geometry and algebraic topology. I enjoy the feeling of getting to know more and more truths about the nature and how people solve problems cleverly.
	I have my own understanding of these subjects: I appreciate the symplectic geometric structure in analytic mechanics and view minimal action principle only as an approximation of Feynman’s path integral method, Levi-Civita connection is Einstein equivalence principle and I like the way we play with to derive macroscale (low energy) behavior by microscopic theory using statistical method and renormalization group, and the like.
	My interests mainly focus on quantum field theory, high energy theory and the mathematical structure hidden behind. I also want to learn more about quantum gravity which I barely know nothing about. My passion burns on learning and exploring.
